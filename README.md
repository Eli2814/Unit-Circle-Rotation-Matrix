# Unit-Circle-Rotation-Matrix
Takes an angle and rotates it by however many degrees you want. Output is in degrees and radians (decimal and radical)
100% vibecoded, so while this is ALMOST exactly right, the last issue I wasn't able to fix was that the scrubbing in wave mode is borrowing logic from the unit circle, so you have to scrub in a circle in order to make the cursor follow your intended path on the wave
